# What I learned

- [x] About "with" clause. 1. A "with" clause will take care of closing the cursor for you. 2. We don't need to mention about connection.commit after our sql manipulation, wit clause will take of it as soon as our with clause of database connection is over, it'll comit the transaction automatic. Once we're done, It closes the cursor as well however, it doesn't close the connection of our database. so, tha needs to be done manually.
